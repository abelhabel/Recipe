		<h1>Port Steak with New Potatoes</h1>

			This type of food is one of my favorites. Lots of taste, takes a long time to make and many ingredients that sums up to one 
			<strong>special flavour</strong>. In Sweden this meal could be quite common as a Sunday steak. I do not think though that it is that common nowadays. But in earlier times I can imagine that when people had worked hard all week that wanted something hearthy to eat on the sunday.

			If you would like to try this recipe sometime, which I think you should, you should do it on a day when you don't have much else planned, which most often is sundays I guess.

		<h2>
			This is what you need to do the Port steak.
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 <em>Big</em> chunk o meat. (We used 600 g but 1,5 kg would be better)</li>
			<li>3 Garlics</li>
			<li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
			<li>15 Black Pepper corns</li>
			<li>Thyme</li>
			<li>3 dl Port Wine</li>
			<li>2 dl Black Current Juice (concentrated)</li>
			<li>4 Carrots</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			First off you need to fry the steak on all sides and you need to do this in a cast iron pot. Do this with high heat and don' fry it for too long. The purpose of it is to keep the meat juice inside the meat so it does not get dry. Once you have fried all sides of the steaks you should lower the heat. Now throw down crushed garlics, shopped onion, big pieces of carrot and let it fry for a bit until the tastes come out. You will be able to smell it. If the pot is too hot though you will burn the garlic and that will defeat the purpose of putting garlic in. Once you are able to smell the wonderful scents of the onion and garlic you can pour in the Port Wine and the Black Currant juice along with the Thyme and the Black Pepper corns. All you now need to do is to put a lid on and leave it there or 2-3 hours.
		</p>
		<h2>
			To make the potatoes you need the following:
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Potatoes</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Fill a big pot with water and throw in the potatoes, sprinkle a lot of salt as well in there. Wait for half an hour up to 40 minutes and they are done.

		<p>
			When the meat is finished you simply pick up the chunk and place it on a cutting board. I would recommend a wooden cutting board because it looks more professional. Place it up side down so the juices that are now on the bottom will pour down, inside the meat. I have know idea how this works but trust me, it does.
		</p>
		<h2>
			To make the gravy:
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Cream</li>
			<li>Liquid from the steak</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Now you will have a big pot filled with delicious liquid with chunks of carrots, garlic and what have you. To separate the chunks from the liquid you need a strainer.  So, pour the content of the pot through the strainer and make sure you have a bowl under the strainer so you don't lose this liquid. Now you need to pour the liquid into the pot again. Add cream as much as you see fit, not more than 50% of the liquid though. Stir for 5 minutes and you have one of the best gravies you'll ever taste.

			Serve it all as the picture describes.
